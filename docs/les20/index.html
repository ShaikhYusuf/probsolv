Analyze and Develop Action Plan</h1><section _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919 class="overview"><h2 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Overview</h2><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>John now moves on to the next step of his problem-solving process: analyzing his spending and developing a plan to reduce it. This is a crucial part of testing his hypothesis and moving closer to his goal.</p></section><section _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919 class="analysis"><h2 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Analysis #1: How Much Can John Reduce His Spending?</h2><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>John starts by reviewing his spending over the past three months, making a list of every purchase he can remember:</p><ul _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Video game: $9</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Candy bar: $1</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Comic books: $4 per month</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Sports drink after baseball games: Regular purchase</li></ul><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Using this information, John develops a more accurate understanding of his spending patterns. By creating a pie chart to visualize his expenditures, John discovers something unexpected:</p><blockquote _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919> "His hypothesis that reducing his spending on CDs and video games would have the biggest impact is incorrect. In reality, he spends more on sports drinks and comic books, not on the items he originally thought." </blockquote><h3 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Reevaluating Priorities</h3><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>As John reviews the pie chart, he realizes that some purchases are easier to cut than others. For example, while sports drinks and comic books represent a significant portion of his spending, John is reluctant to give them up. He values these purchases for personal enjoyment and social reasons:</p><ul _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><strong _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Things John could give up:</strong> Listening to new CDs, Playing new games</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><strong _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Things John does not want to give up:</strong> Drinking sports drinks after baseball practice, Reading comic books, Eating candy</li></ul><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>This insight leads John to rethink his approach: he must balance the financial impact of cutting back with his willingness to sacrifice certain items.</p><h3 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Matrix Analysis for Spending Reduction</h3><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>To organize his thoughts and make a clear decision, John uses a matrix to rank his spending. On the vertical axis, he ranks his average monthly spending. On the horizontal axis, he categorizes items into those he cannot give up (on the left) and those he can give up (on the right).</p><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>This matrix helps John prioritize which spending cuts will have the greatest impact while considering his personal preferences:</p><table _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919 class="spending-matrix"><tr _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><th _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Cannot Give Up</th><th _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Can Give Up</th></tr><tr _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><td _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Sports Drinks</td><td _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>CDs and Video Games</td></tr><tr _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><td _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Comic Books</td><td _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Candy</td></tr></table><h3 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Making Adjustments</h3><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>John realizes that while he is unwilling to fully give up sports drinks or comic books, he can reduce the costs associated with these purchases. He brainstorms a few strategies:</p><ul _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><strong _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Sports Drinks:</strong> Instead of buying a sports drink at the baseball diamond, John decides to buy a cheaper powdered sports drink mix, make it at home, and bring it to the games in a water jug. This reduces the cost significantly.</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><strong _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Comic Books:</strong> John decides to co-purchase comic books with a friend, which helps cut his monthly spending on this item by sharing the costs.</li></ul><h3 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Final Action Plan</h3><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>After implementing these changes, John is able to reduce his overall spending:</p><ul _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><strong _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Sports drinks and comic books:</strong> Reduced by 50%.</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><strong _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Total reduction in spending:</strong> From $15 per month to $5 per month.</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><strong _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Resulting savings over 6 months:</strong> $60 ($10 per month x 6 months).</li></ul><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>With this reduction, the remaining gap to reach his $500 goal is now $188.</p></section><section _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919 class="analysis"><h2 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Analysis #3: How Much Can John Increase His Income by Switching Jobs?</h2><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>John now focuses on increasing his income to close the remaining gap of $138. He begins by gathering information from his friends and neighbors about part-time job opportunities and pay rates.</p><h3 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Step 1: Gathering Information on Local Job Pay</h3><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><strong _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Friend Survey:</strong> John asks five of his friends about their part-time jobs and how much they earn. Here are the results:</p><ul _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Some friends with specialized skills (e.g., web design or foreign-language expertise) earn between $6 to $8 per hour.</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Friends without specialized skills typically make $2 to $3 per hour.</li></ul><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>John compares this with his own income as a dog walker, where he currently makes $3 per hour. He realizes that his rate isn't too bad, as other dog walkers are only paid $2 per hour.</p><h3 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Step 2: Assessing the Gap and Exploring Options</h3><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>John now faces the challenge of earning an additional $138 over the next six months. This means he needs to increase his income by approximately $23 per month, which requires an additional $6 per hour in pay.</p><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>However, John’s town has relatively low wages for students, and no one offered him a higher-paying job than the $3 per hour he already earns. At this point, John is almost ready to give up.</p><h3 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Step 3: Creative Solution to Increase Income</h3><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Before he gives up, John has a creative idea: What if he walked two more dogs at once? He recalls seeing someone in New York City walking multiple dogs at the same time and realizes that this could be a way to increase his hourly income.</p><ul _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><strong _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Plan:</strong> John decides to walk three dogs at once, which would allow him to earn $9 per hour ($3 per dog).</li><li _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919><strong _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Approval:</strong> He asks the owners of the three dogs if it would be okay to walk them simultaneously. They are happy to agree, especially after hearing about his goal to buy a computer and pursue his Hollywood dream. The owners even joke that John should come back for autographs once he’s famous!</li></ul><h3 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Step 4: Final Plan</h3><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>With this new approach, John is able to increase his hourly earnings to $9 per hour. By walking three dogs simultaneously, he’s found a way to significantly boost his income without having to take on additional work hours.</p><h3 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>Conclusion</h3><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>John’s creative solution to walk multiple dogs at once has provided him with a way to increase his income. By implementing this plan, John is now well on his way to closing the remaining $138 gap and achieving his goal of buying the $500 computer.</p></section><section _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919 class="execution"><h2 _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>The Most Critical Step: Execution</h2><p _ngcontent-ng-c1808997919>John has successfully completed the planning process.
