    <h1>Lesson 18: Problem-Solving Toolbox: Hypothesis Pyramid</h1>
    
    <section class="overview">
      <h2>The Hypothesis Pyramid</h2>
      <p>The Hypothesis Pyramid is an effective tool for organizing your thoughts, structuring your argument, and clearly communicating your hypothesis. The pyramid structure places the conclusion or main message at the top, supported by rationales or reasons at the base. This method ensures logical organization and strengthens your argument.</p>

      <h2>Two Types of Hypothesis Pyramid</h2>
      <div class="type">
        <h3>1. Grouping Structure</h3>
        <p>This structure is used when your conclusion is supported by several independent but related ideas. Each rationale is a separate piece of evidence that supports the conclusion.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conclusion (Top): "School is fun."</li>
          <li>Supporting Rationales (Base):
            <ul>
              <li>"School sports are fun."</li>
              <li>"Lunchtime is fun."</li>
              <li>"Classes are fun."</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even if one rationale is proven incorrect, the conclusion could still stand due to the support of other rationales.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="type">
        <h3>2. Argument Structure</h3>
        <p>This structure is used when each supporting rationale directly contributes to proving the conclusion. If one rationale is incorrect, the conclusion will be false.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conclusion (Top): "Salmon are good swimmers."</li>
          <li>Supporting Rationales (Base):
            <ul>
              <li>"Salmon are fish."</li>
              <li>"Fish are good swimmers."</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this case, the truth of the conclusion depends on the validity of both premises.</p>

      <h2>Organizing Problems with the Hypothesis Pyramid</h2>
      <p>Letâ€™s apply the pyramid structure to a couple of example problems.</p>
      
      <div class="problem">
        <h3>Problem 1: "School is fun."</h3>
        <p><strong>Conclusion (Top):</strong> School is fun.</p>
        <p><strong>Supporting Rationales (Base):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>"School sports are fun."</li>
          <li>"Lunchtime is fun."</li>
          <li>"Classes are fun."</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  
      <div class="problem">
        <h3>Problem 2: "Salmon are good swimmers."</h3>
        <p><strong>Conclusion (Top):</strong> Salmon are good swimmers.</p>
        <p><strong>Supporting Rationales (Base):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>"Salmon are fish."</li>
          <li>"Fish are good swimmers."</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>
  
    <section class="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The Hypothesis Pyramid is a powerful tool for structuring both groupings of related ideas and logical arguments. Whether you're presenting a general argument (grouping structure) or testing a logical hypothesis (argument structure), this method ensures that your reasoning is clear, well-supported, and organized.</p>
