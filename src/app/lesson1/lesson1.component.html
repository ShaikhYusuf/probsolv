      <h2>Miss Sigh</h2>
      <p>Miss Sigh gives up at the first sign of trouble. She sighs and says, “I’ll never be able to do that,” not because she can’t, but because she fears failure and ridicule.</p>
      <ul class="quotes">
        <li>"I’m not talented enough."</li>
        <li>"What if I fail? Everyone will laugh."</li>
        <li>"Nobody cares about me. It’s all their fault."</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mr. Critic</h2>
      <p>Mr. Critic never hesitates to point out flaws but rarely contributes solutions. He thrives on saying, “I told you so,” and is quick to assign blame when things go wrong.</p>
      <ul class="quotes">
        <li>"That’s a stupid idea!"</li>
        <li>"It failed because of you."</li>
        <li>"I told you what to do—why didn’t it work?"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Miss Dreamer</h2>
      <p>Miss Dreamer is full of ideas but never follows through. She loves imagining big goals—writing novels, starting businesses—but avoids planning or acting on them.</p>
      <ul class="quotes">
        <li>"I want to write a novel someday."</li>
        <li>"I’m an idea person—don’t bother me with details."</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mr. Go-Getter</h2>
      <p>Mr. Go-Getter tackles problems head-on, refusing to dwell on past mistakes. While his persistence and action-oriented approach are admirable, his lack of reflection often leads him astray.</p>
      <ul class="quotes">
        <li>"I just need to try harder!"</li>
        <li>"Thinking is a waste of time; it’s all about execution."</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Problem-Solving Kid</h2>
      <p>Problem-solving kids strike the perfect balance between action and thought. They embrace challenges without hesitation, but also take time to identify root causes, create actionable plans, and adapt as needed.</p>
      <ul class="quotes">
        <li>"What caused this problem, and how can I fix it?"</li>
        <li>"Here’s my plan: X, Y, and Z. Let’s start and adjust if needed."</li>
        <li>"What worked? What didn’t? How can we improve next time?"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Power of Evolution</h2>
      <p>Problem-solving isn’t innate; it’s a habit anyone can develop. With every challenge, problem-solving kids evolve, learning from outcomes and improving over time.</p>
      <p>Example: Over three years, the three fruit stand owners evolve with different growth rates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alex grows by 1% monthly, selling 143 watermelons.</li>
        <li>Bianca grows by 5%, reaching 579 watermelons.</li>
        <li>Cliff grows by 10%, selling a staggering 3,091 watermelons.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Big Picture</h2>
      <p>Problem-solving kids don’t just tackle personal challenges—they shape their environment. They lead teams, drive change in their communities, and solve bigger, world-changing problems.</p>
      <p>By adopting the right mindset and habits, anyone can evolve into a problem-solving kid, turning obstacles into stepping stones for growth and success.</p>
