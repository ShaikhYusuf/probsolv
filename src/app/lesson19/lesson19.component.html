    <h1>Lesson 19: 4A. Determining the Analyses and Information Required to Test the Hypothesis</h1>
    
    <section class="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Once John has developed a hypothesis for how he can achieve his goal, the next step is to identify the necessary analyses and information required to test it. This process involves gathering relevant data and breaking down the steps needed to validate each part of his hypothesis. John will use a problem-solving design plan to organize and clarify his approach.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="steps">
      <h2>Step-by-Step Process</h2>
  
      <h3>Step 1: Identify the Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>John's first hypothesis is:</p>
      <blockquote>
        "I can reduce most of my spending if I stop buying CDs and games."
      </blockquote>
  
      <h3>Step 2: Plan for Analysis and Information Gathering</h3>
      <p>To test this hypothesis, John needs to gather specific data and perform targeted analyses. Here's how he plans to proceed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Analyze Spending:</strong> Review spending over the past three months and create a list of purchases to understand current habits.</li>
        <li><strong>Categorize Purchases:</strong> Categorize spending into areas like entertainment and food to identify where costs can be reduced.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Step 3: Additional Hypotheses and Actions</h3>
      <p>John has two additional hypotheses related to increasing his income and selling assets. He needs to gather further information for these hypotheses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sellable Assets Search and Price Research:</strong> Identify items to sell (books, electronics), then research their market value.</li>
        <li><strong>Part-Time Job Research:</strong> Explore part-time job opportunities by interviewing friends and neighbors about available positions and pay rates.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Step 4: Design Plan Summary</h3>
      <p>Hereâ€™s a breakdown of John's action plan to test his hypotheses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spending Breakdown and Spending Cut Identification:</strong> Analyze past purchases, categorize spending, and identify areas for reduction (e.g., stopping purchases of CDs and games).</li>
        <li><strong>Sellable Assets Search and Sell-Price Research:</strong> Identify assets to sell, research their market value, and estimate potential earnings.</li>
        <li><strong>Part-Time Job Pay Interviews with Friends:</strong> Gather information about pay rates for part-time jobs from friends.</li>
        <li><strong>Part-Time Job Availability Interviews with Neighbors:</strong> Investigate local job opportunities by talking to neighbors about available positions.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>By clarifying the necessary analyses and information, John is now equipped with a structured plan to test his hypotheses. Each step in the plan will provide him with the data needed to evaluate whether his hypotheses are valid and help him move closer to achieving his goal of buying the computer.</p>
