    <h1>Lesson 17: Selecting the Best Ideas and Formulating a Hypothesis</h1>
    
    <section class="steps">
      <h2>Step 1: Evaluate and Eliminate Ineffective Ideas</h2>
      <p>John begins by reviewing the ideas generated in his logic tree and eliminating those that are not feasible or align with his values. Some of the eliminated ideas include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Money from others (John prefers not to rely on others for help).</li>
        <li>Increase working time (John cannot afford to spend more time working due to his focus on baseball and schoolwork).</li>
        <li>Invest (John lacks investment knowledge).</li>
        <li>Play the lottery (John believes the low probability of success makes it an impractical option).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  
    <section class="hypothesis">
      <h2>Step 2: Formulate a Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>With the remaining feasible options, John formulates a hypothesis to guide his efforts:</p>
      <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> "I can buy the $500 used Apple computer within six months if I switch to a higher-paying job, sell some used books, and stop buying CDs and games."</p>
      <p>This hypothesis outlines the goal (buying the computer) and the supporting actions (switching jobs, selling books, reducing discretionary spending).</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="assumption">
      <h2>Step 3: Understand the Hypothesis is Still an Assumption</h2>
      <p>Although John has a clear hypothesis, he must understand that it remains an assumption until it is tested. For instance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Switching to a higher-paying job: John believes this is possible based on his friend Kevinâ€™s hourly wage. However, John is unsure of the specifics of Kevin's job, whether he can perform similar work, or if such a job is available.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This hypothesis is just a starting point and needs further testing and validation.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="testing">
      <h2>Step 4: Efficiency in Testing the Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>With a well-structured hypothesis, John can focus on gathering information and testing each part of the hypothesis. This structured approach will help him determine whether the hypothesis is valid or if adjustments are needed.</p>
