      <h2>The Mushroom Lovers' Concert Attendance Problem</h2>
      <p>
        The concert attendance problem can be understood using a logic tree and yes/no decision tree, breaking down the issue into key questions and potential causes.

    <section>
      <h2>Logic Tree</h2>
  
      <div class="logic-tree">
        <h3>Awareness (A)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Inadequate promotion or advertising of the concerts.</li>
          <li>Poor visibility of promotional materials (e.g., posters in low-traffic areas).</li>
          <li>Lack of online or social media presence.</li>
          <li>Target audience not clearly defined, leading to ineffective outreach.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>Interest (B)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>People are aware of the concerts but do not find the band appealing.</li>
          <li>Mismatch between the band's music style and the audience’s preferences.</li>
          <li>Lack of credibility as a professional band.</li>
          <li>Competing events scheduled at the same time.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>Retention (C)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Poor concert experience (e.g., sound quality, performance, or atmosphere).</li>
          <li>Lack of variety or improvement in the shows over time.</li>
          <li>Negative word-of-mouth from past attendees.</li>
          <li>Disorganized event management (e.g., scheduling delays).</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Yes/No Tree Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Are they aware of the concerts?</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>If NO, focus on improving awareness (A).</li>
            <li>If YES, move to the next question.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>If they are aware, have they ever been to a concert?</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>If NO, focus on increasing interest (B).</li>
            <li>If YES, move to the next question.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>If they have been to a concert, do they attend consistently?</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>If NO, focus on retention strategies (C).</li>
            <li>If YES, continue nurturing these loyal attendees.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>
  
    <section>
      <h2>Investigating the Root Causes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conduct Surveys or Interviews:</strong> Ask non-attendees why they haven’t attended and gather feedback from past attendees about their experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Assess Marketing Efforts:</strong> Review the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and analyze whether the target audience has been reached.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluate the Concert Experience:</strong> Check the quality of sound, lighting, and overall performance to see if the events meet or exceed expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Benchmark Against Competitors:</strong> Study how other local bands attract and retain their audience.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  
    <section>
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Measure the size of each bucket in the yes/no tree:
          <ul>
            <li>Who is unaware?</li>
            <li>Who is aware but uninterested?</li>
            <li>Who has attended but not returned?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Identify patterns or common themes behind each root cause.</li>
        <li>Prioritize addressing the most significant issues first:
          <ul>
            <li>Awareness campaigns (social media, posters, partnerships).</li>
            <li>Enhancing the value of the concert experience.</li>
            <li>Building credibility as a band through collaborations or community engagement.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
