    <h1 class="title">Problem-Solving Toolbox: The Design Plan</h1>
  
    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Jumping into data collection and analysis without defining the problem leads to wasted effort and confusion. A Problem-Solving Design Plan includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clarification of the issues being addressed.</li>
        <li>Stating the current hypotheses and their rationale.</li>
        <li>Listing the analyses, actions, and required information to validate or disprove the hypotheses.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Benefits of a Design Plan</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Increases focus and productivity.</li>
        <li>Clarifies thought processes and aligns team efforts.</li>
        <li>Ensures efficient use of time and resources, focusing only on what is needed to make decisions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Eggplant and Tofu’s design plan allowed them to address the problem systematically.

      <h2>1D. Analyze and Identify the Root Cause</h2>
  
      <div class="analysis">
        <h3>Analysis 1: Audience Awareness Breakdown</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Categorize the audience into awareness levels to understand concert attendance patterns.</p>
        <h4>Survey Results:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Population:</strong> 500 students and teachers.</li>
          <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> 30% (150 people) aware; 70% (350 people) unaware.</li>
          <li><strong>Attendance among aware individuals:</strong> 10% (15 people) attended; 90% (135 people) didn’t.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular attendance:</strong> 80% (12 people) attend regularly; 20% (3 people) stopped.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Key Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Most of the school (70%) is unaware of the concerts.</li>
          <li>Awareness alone does not drive attendance; only 10% of aware individuals attend.</li>
          <li>Retention is high (80%) among those who attend at least once.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Revised Hypothesis:</h4>
        <p>
          Increasing awareness alone will not significantly boost attendance. Investigate why aware individuals do not attend and why some stop returning.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="analysis">
        <h3>Analysis 2: Reasons for Non-Attendance Despite Awareness</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Understand why aware individuals avoid attending concerts.</p>
        <h4>Findings from Interviews:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Uncertainty about the band’s music quality.</li>
          <li>Schedule conflicts (e.g., sports games).</li>
          <li>Lack of interest in music.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Key Insight:</h4>
        <p>
          Efforts should focus on improving the band’s visibility and reputation (e.g., showcasing music quality) and addressing scheduling conflicts.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="analysis">
        <h3>Analysis 3: Understanding Irregular Attendance</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Identify why attendees stop returning and determine how to sustain regular attendance.</p>
        <h4>Findings from Interviews:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Feedback from fans:</strong> Positive reactions to performances but criticism about repetitive song selections causing boredom.</li>
          <li><strong>Feedback from those who stopped attending:</strong> All cited repetitive performances as the main reason for disengagement.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Key Insight:</h4>
        <p>
          To retain attendees, the band must introduce variety and freshness to their performances, such as new songs or unique show elements.

      <h2>Key Lessons and Actions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Avoid Acting on Assumptions:</strong> Testing hypotheses prevents wasted effort on ineffective strategies (e.g., increasing awareness alone).</li>
        <li><strong>Targeted Strategies Work Better:</strong> Focus on addressing specific barriers to attendance (e.g., concert timing, perceived quality).</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Improvement Matters:</strong> Incorporating audience feedback helps maintain engagement and loyalty.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        By following their design plan and conducting focused analyses, Eggplant and Tofu uncovered the root causes of low concert attendance. Armed with actionable insights, they are ready to fill the gymnasium and move closer to their dream of becoming professional musicians.
