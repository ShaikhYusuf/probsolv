    <section>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        To test their hypothesis, Eggplant and Tofu must gather and analyze relevant information. This step ensures
        purposeful data collection and analysis, driving better decision-making.

      <h2>Analyses and Information Requirements</h2>
      <p>Eggplant and Tofu need to address three key questions through targeted analyses:</p>
  
      <div class="analysis">
        <h3>Analysis 1: Categorizing Audience Awareness</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Understand how the audience at Mushroom Lovers’ School is distributed across four awareness categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not aware of the concerts.</li>
          <li>Aware but not attending.</li>
          <li>Attended at least once.</li>
          <li>Regular attendees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Surveying all 500 students individually is impractical and time-consuming.</li>
          <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Conduct a Monday morning homeroom survey through teachers.</li>
          <li>
            Teachers will ask three simple questions and count hand raises:
            <ul>
              <li>Do you know about the Mushroom Lovers’ monthly concerts?</li>
              <li>Have you ever attended a Mushroom Lovers’ concert?</li>
              <li>Do you attend Mushroom Lovers’ concerts regularly?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Efficient data collection in under three minutes, offering a clear categorization of the audience.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="analysis">
        <h3>Analysis 2: Reasons for Non-Attendance Despite Awareness</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Identify why some aware individuals choose not to attend concerts.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Method:</strong> Conduct targeted interviews with a small sample size (approximately five individuals).</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Implementation:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Ask teachers to provide names of students aware of the concerts but who have never attended.</li>
              <li>Interview these students to uncover key barriers to attendance.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Gain insights into primary reasons for non-attendance, enabling actionable solutions.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="analysis">
        <h3>Analysis 3: Understanding Irregular Attendance</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Determine why some attendees do not return regularly and assess future attendance potential.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Method:</strong> Interview individuals who attended but stopped returning (sample size: five people).</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Key Questions:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>What were the strengths and weaknesses of past concerts?</li>
              <li>What would encourage consistent attendance?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Identify areas for improvement to retain loyal attendees and transform one-time attendees into regular fans.</p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The purpose of collecting and analyzing information is to make informed decisions, not for its own sake.</li>
        <li>Efficient methods, such as group surveys and targeted interviews, optimize time and resources.</li>
        <li>Focused insights enable Eggplant and Tofu to refine their strategies, improving both attendance and loyalty.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By following this structured approach, Eggplant and Tofu can validate their hypothesis and enhance the success of Mushroom Lovers’ concerts.
