      <h2>John’s Dream</h2>
      <p>
        John Octopus dreams of becoming a Hollywood CGI movie director, but he knows that achieving such a big goal requires a solid foundation. 
        His first step is to acquire the tools to learn CGI animation—a computer. 
        To ensure success, John needs to transform his vague dream into a clear and actionable goal.

      <h2>Step 1: Setting a Clear Goal</h2>
      <p>
        To set an effective goal, John must answer three critical questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What does he want?</li>
        <li>When does he want it?</li>
        <li>What specific conditions apply?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After researching computers suitable for CGI, John decides on a $500 used Apple computer, ideal for beginners in animation. 
        He also sets a firm deadline: he must acquire the computer within six months to start designing his family’s holiday card by December. 
        Finally, John specifies that he does not want to borrow money or rent a computer—he intends to purchase it outright using his own resources.

      <h2>John’s Goal Statement</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "I want to buy a $500 used Apple computer within six months without borrowing money from others."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Defines the type of computer and cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Sets a clear six-month deadline.</li>
        <li><strong>Condition-based:</strong> Outlines how the goal will be achieved (without borrowing).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Importance of Specific Goals</h2>
      <p>
        John’s initial thought, "I want a computer," lacked clarity. 
        The refined goal, on the other hand, provides:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A clear target to aim for.</li>
        <li>A timeframe to motivate action.</li>
        <li>Defined parameters for decision-making (e.g., no borrowing).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By establishing this specific goal, John lays the groundwork for a focused action plan to achieve it.
