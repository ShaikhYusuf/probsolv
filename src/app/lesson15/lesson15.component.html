      <h2>John’s Current Financial Situation</h2>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> $500 (cost of the computer)</p>
      <p><strong>Current Savings:</strong> $150</p>
      <p><strong>Allowance:</strong> $20/month</p>
      <p><strong>Dog-Walking Income:</strong> $12/month ($3/hour, 1 hour per week)</p>
      <p><strong>Monthly Spending:</strong> $15/month</p>
  
      <div class="details">
        <p><strong>Projected Savings in Six Months:</strong> $252</p>
        <p><strong>Gap:</strong> $248 (Goal: $500 - Projected Savings: $252)</p>
      </div>
    </section>
  
    <section class="formula">
      <h2>Formula</h2>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Projected savings = Current savings + (Number of months × [Monthly allowance + Dog-walking income - Monthly spending])</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="calculation">
      <h2>Calculation</h2>
      <p><strong>Calculation:</strong> 150 + 6 × [20 + 12 - 15] = 150 + 102 = 252</p>

    <section class="outcome">
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>John’s projected savings after six months is $252, which is $248 short of the $500 goal. John needs to find additional ways to increase his income or reduce his expenses to meet the gap within six months.</p>
