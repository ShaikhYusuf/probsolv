    <section>
      <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>The primary root cause of the low concert attendance is <strong>lack of awareness</strong>.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section>
      <h2>Rationale</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Awareness is the first step:</strong> 
          <ul>
            <li>If people donâ€™t know about the concert, they cannot attend.</li>
            <li>Eggplant and Tofu made minimal effort to spread the word, indicating low awareness.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Awareness to attendance conversion:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Based on their estimate, 60% of those aware would likely attend, as the majority of the school enjoys rock music.</li>
            <li>The lack of effort in informing students explains the sparse attendance.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Audience retention rate is not the issue:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>They assume a 100% return rate because they observed the same faces at multiple concerts.</li>
            <li>This suggests that once people attend, they are satisfied with the experience and continue coming.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps to Validate the Hypothesis</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Estimate Awareness:</strong> Conduct a simple survey to measure how many students are aware of the concerts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Estimate Conversion Rate:</strong> Ask how many of the aware students would have attended if they knew about the event.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Test Audience Retention Rate:</strong> Confirm whether past attendees consistently return to concerts.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Action Plan if Hypothesis Is True</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Promoting the concerts:</strong> Use posters, social media, and announcements to reach more people.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expanding personal invitations:</strong> Go beyond friends and invite a broader group of students.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Creating a buzz:</strong> 
          <ul>
            <li>Share snippets of their performances.</li>
            <li>Offer small incentives like free snacks or raffle tickets at the concert.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By addressing awareness, the Mushroom Lovers can likely improve their attendance significantly.
