    <h1>Lesson 16: Generating Options and Ideas to Close the Gap</h1>
    
    <section class="steps">
      <h2>Step 1: Brainstorm Specific Ideas</h2>
      <p>John begins by listing as many ideas as possible to bridge the gap. Here are some of the ideas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask Mom for a higher allowance.</li>
        <li>Save money.</li>
        <li>Buy a lottery ticket.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While these ideas are not very practical, John should focus on specific and actionable ideas moving forward.</p>

    <section class="logic-tree">
      <h2>Step 2: Use the Logic Tree Framework</h2>
      <p>John applies the Logic Tree to break down his main problem:</p>
      <p><strong>Main Problem:</strong> "How can I buy a $500 used Apple computer in six months without borrowing money from others?"</p>
      
      <h3>Broader Categories</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Increase Income</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Money from others (e.g., ask for gifts, loans)</li>
            <li>Self-generated income (e.g., side jobs, freelancing)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reduce Spending</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Entertainment (e.g., cut back on movie nights, gaming)</li>
            <li>Food and beverages (e.g., meal prep, cooking at home)</li>
            <li>Other (e.g., cancel unused subscriptions, reduce impulse buying)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>John can now ask questions to expand the tree both vertically (additional solutions) and horizontally (more specific actions).</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="expanding-tree">
      <h2>Step 3: Expanding the Tree</h2>
      <p>To further expand the logic tree:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vertically:</strong> Ask, “Are there other ways of solving the problem?”</li>
        <li><strong>Horizontally:</strong> Ask, “Specifically, how can I implement this idea?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By continuing this process, John will generate a variety of actionable options to close the gap.</p>
